0. ${ProjectName} is public domain, BABY!
 - Unless you're listed in the exceptions below. GO CHECK.
1. Do whatever the fuck you want with it. WE JUST DON'T CARE.

2. Stop pestering the creators, unless it's love letters!
3. If you ever make any modifications to this program, please let us know. ONLY A DICK WOULDN'T.
3. Have fun and enjoy using the software!
 - UNLESS YOU'RE LISTED IN THE EXCEPTIONS BELOW, THEN I HOPE YOU SUFFER AS MUCH AS I DID WRITING THIS CODE.

EXCEPTIONS TO THIS LICENSE:

A notable exception goes to the Lead Programmer for YU-RIS Engine
Known online as Honowi / Honoppe.
I hated every single second of guessing how the fuck does yu-ris
use all the stupid ass microfunctions you wrote without documentation.
This exception will not apply if the subject gets to lose his virginity
to someone that's not a Dia Kurosawa lifesize dakimakura.

Another exception goes to progvian, from the Fuwanovel Forums.
You could've made your damn YU-RIS text replacer code open source.
That would've saved me the trouble of finding another tool fit for the job.
This exception will not apply if the subject makes YU-RIS text replacer open-source.
